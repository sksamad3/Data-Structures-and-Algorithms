    Multimaps:
1. Duplicate keys allowed: Multiple entries with the same key are allowed.
2. Key-value pairs: Each element is a key-value pair, just like a map.
3. orted order: Keys are automatically sorted in ascending order (by default) based on the comparator (like std::less).
4. Implementation: Internally implemented as a balanced binary search tree, like map.
5.  Insertions, deletions, and searching take O(log n) time.
6. No direct access: Unlike map[key], you cannot use the subscript operator [] to access or modify elements.
